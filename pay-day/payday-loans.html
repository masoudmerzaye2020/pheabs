                        emergency, car repairs or your rent is due. </p>
                    <p>Also known as a ‘payday advance,’ you can get money upfront and paid in one lump sum to pay off
                        any pressing bills – and then you can repay the loan and interest in full on your next pay date.
                        So ideally, your emergency is just a one-off and you can be back on your feet in no-time.</p>
                    <p>Today, with payday loan apps and alternatives, the average loan will typically last a couple of
                        weeks – and Pheabs is able to give options ranging from 12 to 60 months. This gives you a bit
                        more breathing space and rather than borrowing $300 and paying back in full just a few weeks
                        later, you may wish to borrow a bit more and for longer.</p>

                        <p>Payday loans are for short-term purposes and lasting just a few weeks, they are intended to
                            cover shortfalls of cash for households. The idea is that you receive the money upfront in
                            lump sum to help pay off your emergency, and then you can receive your income from work on
                            your next payday, and then pay back your loan in full – including:</p>

                            <li>U.S. resident</li>

                        <p>Our partner lenders are willing to take a view on different credit histories, so you can

                        <p>We will always carry out a series of income and affordability checks, just to ensure that you

                            How Do Repayments Work?</h1>
                        <p>Repayments for payday loans work in equal monthly installments – so if you borrow over 3
                            months, you will be paying 3 identical repayment amounts at the end of each month.</p>
                        <p>Depending on which lender you are connected with, you can repay your loan after just one
                            month, or as long as 12 months or 60 months if you prefer.</p>
                        <p>For quick and fast payday loans, you may need to borrow money upfront, pay off any pressing
                            debts and then repay your loan in full at the end of the month – so it only ends up lasting
                            just a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>But if you are borrowing some of the larger amounts such as $1,000, $5,000 or $10,000, you
                            may wish to spread repayment over 12, 24, 48 or 60 months to give you extra breathing space.
                        </p>
                        <p>The lender will collect the repayments from your bank account each month automatically, so
                            you do not need to call up, make a manual payment or send in a cheque, it is all processed
                            automatically to make life easier.</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p>Yes, you can get a payday loan with bad credit scores – we work with a number of different
                            lenders who are willing to consider all kinds of credit scores and can offer the right

                        <p>When applying for a payday loan online, you are not expected to have a perfect credit score –
                            and our lenders will take in other factors such as your income, employment, age and the
                            amount you have requested to borrow. All of these factors can tell the lender a lot about
                            your chances of repaying a loan – and it is not just the credit score that they look at.

                    <p>Payday loans without credit checks are a little harder to find. Regulated and licensed payday
                        lenders in the US typically need to run a credit check before approving your loan request. This
                        will confirm that you can afford to repay your loan based on your credit history and will not
                        fall into difficulty. </p>
                    <p>Although most loan companies will run a credit check, there are some other lenders who will use
                        other indicators such as pay check, monthly income and employment information – and still
                        approve your loan on this basis.</p>
                    <p>For larger loans, they may request collateral and secure your loan against a car, property or
                        jewellery, but these are more long term loans, rather than payday loans. However, when secured
                        against something valuable, the success of your loan is based more on the item’s value, rather
                        than your credit score, so it is possible to submit a loan request with no credit checks.</p>
                    <h1 class="orange">What Payday Loan Alternatives Are There?</h1>
                    <p>There are a number of payday loans alternatives available through Pheabs and the partners that we
                        work with, including a range of products, apps, startups and more.</p>
                    <p>One of our main alternatives is installment loans, which allow you to spread repayment over
                        several months and this is often preferred by a lot of customers, since it means you do not need

                        and get back on your feet.</p>
                    <p>Other products we can offer include title loans, which are secured against your car or using
                        different apps which allow you to drawdown money, repay and top up if you need to.</p>
                    <p>Of course, one of the best and oldest alternatives is to simply borrow money from family and
                        friends. This is usually interest-free, not subject to credit checks and comes with flexible
                        repayment terms. This should usually be your first point of call if you need emergency cash. But
                        if you are looking to apply online and get a quick turnaround, Pheabs is delighted to help you
                        with your requirements every step of the way.</p>

                        Where Can I Find a Payday Loan With Guaranteed Approval?</h1>
                    <p>If you looking for a guaranteed payday loan online, this is not always possible since you will
                        need to meet the initial criteria in terms of age, employment, minimum income and be able to
                        pass our series of credit checks and affordability checks.</p>
                    <p>Whilst a guaranteed loan is not always possible, we work with such a wide range of lenders that
                        we will do our best to give you a loan offer today. We will always consider different applicants
                        and backgrounds and in some cases, we may recommend credit unions, apps or using a product
                        secured against your car or home.</p>

                    <h1 class="orange">Can I Get a Payday Loan on The Same Day of Applying?</h1>
                    <p>Yes, it is possible to get a same day payday loan, so long as you meet the criteria, which
                        includes being over 18 years of age, have a stable employment and income, social security number
                        and live checking account for your funds to be paid into.</p>
                    <p>To maximise your chances of receiving loans on the same day, make sure that all the information
                        that you enter is accurate and that you meet all the criteria points provided. It might be
                        helpful to have a copy of your pay stub or bank statement in case the lender asks for proof of
                        income or employment.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, if you apply during work hours of Monday to Friday from 9AM to 5PM, this should also
                        maximise your chances of getting funds within 24 hours, rather than applying on a slow Sunday or
                        national holiday.</p>

                    <h1 class="orange">Can I Get a Payday Loan With an Instant Decision?</h1>
                    <p>Yes, payday loans are designed to give you instant approval, so you can fill in your details in
                        less than 5 minutes and receive an indicative decision on the screen. Because the loans are
                        unsecured, your eligibility is based on various factors which can be processed automatically,
                        giving you an instant decision. However, to be fully approved and funded, you will need to
                        electronically sign your loan agreement and often undergo further checks such as credit and
                        affordability checks – just so you can afford the amount you wish to borrow without falling into
                        financial trouble.</p>
                    <h1 class="orange">Can I Apply for Loans Near Me?</h1>
                    <p>Yes, by working with a number of payday loans companies near me, we can connect your loan enquiry
                        with a lender who is based in your State, including Nevada, Texas, Ohio, California and Illinois
                        (and all 37 states where payday loans are legalised). </p>
                    <p>This can be important, since loan terms and interest rates can vary between States. However, we
                        also work with lenders who operate in multiple jurisdictions so that you can be approved
                        wherever you are in the US.</p>
                    <p>Whilst a lot of these States offer local payday stores, our process is fully online, so you do
                        not have to visit a branch, line up or wait for a decision. Everything with Pheabs is handled
                        and processed online, so you can complete our application form in 5 minutes, get an instant and
                        receive funds in just a few hours if you are approved.</p>

                        <p><b>Why Should I Apply for Payday Loans Direct Lenders?</b></p>
                        <p>Working with direct lenders can offer a lot of peace of mind when applying for loan. When you
                            are working with the lender directly, you can feel confident that your details are being
                            kept safely and that you are in control of your application.</p>
                        <p>At Pheabs, we work with direct lenders only, so once you have completed our form, you will
                            continue to work with your selected lender every step of the way. From the loan being
                            processed, funded and repayments collected, everything will be handled by your chosen lender
                            and you can be rest assured that there are no surprise fees or other parties involved.</p>
                        <p><b>How Much Does a Payday Loan Online Cost?</b></p>
                        <p>The cost of a payday loan ranges from 36% APR to 5,000% APR depending on various factors such
                            as your credit score, income, affordability and also the State that you live in. After all,
                            some US States have price caps and others are more lenient to charge higher amounts.</p>
                        <p><b>Representative example:</b></p>
                        <p><b>Based on a loan amount of $750 over 12 months. Rate of interest 292% (fixed).
                                Representative 171% APR. Total repayment amount $1351.20 and total interest is $601.20,
                                equal to 12 monthly payments of $112.60.*</b></p>
                        <p>For good credit score customers, you may be able to access ranges from 36% APR, but those
                            with bad credit histories are more likely to pay up to 5,000% APR.</p>
                        <p>Whilst this percentage rate might seem very high, this is designed to be used for just a few
                            weeks and then repaid in full. The APR is a measure of annual interest which is 12 months,
                            and therefore your rate is multiplied over and over and is not necessarily a try reflection
                            of the cost.</p>
                        <p><b>What Payday Loan Alternatives Are There?</b></p>
                        here are a number of payday loans alternatives available through Pheabs and the partners that we
                        work with, including a range of products, apps, startups and more. <br>
                        ne of our main alternatives is installment loans, which allow you to spread repayment over
                        several months and this is often preferred by a lot of customers, since it means you do not need
                        to pay the full balance at the end of the month, but you have time to get your finances in order
                        and get back on your feet. <br>
                        Other products we can offer include title loans, which are secured against your car or using
                        different apps which allow you to drawdown money, repay and top up if you need to. <br>
                        Of course, one of the best and oldest alternatives is to simply borrow money from family and
                        friends. This is usually interest-free, not subject to credit checks and comes with flexible
                        repayment terms. This should usually be your first point of call if you need emergency cash. But
                        if you are looking to apply online and get a quick turnaround, Pheabs is delighted to help you

                        <p><b>How Much Can I Borrow From a Payday Loan?</b></p>
                        <p>Pheabs offers payday loans of $300, $500, $1,000, $2,000 or higher – the amount you can
                            borrow is based on a number of factors including your income, employment, credit score,
                            affordability, track record and more.</p>
                        <p><b>Can I Make Loan Repayments Online or By Phone?</b></p>
                        <p>Your repayments are collected automatically through a system known as ACH authorization which
                            debits your account on your scheduled repayment date. There is no need to call up or make a
                            manual repayment since this is designed to be automatic, you just need to have money
                            available in your account on the agreed date for collection. If you prefer, you can always
                            call up or log into the account section of your lender’s website and make a manual repayment
                            or pay off your loan early if you would like to.</p>
                        <p><b>Can I Renew My Payday Loan?</b></p>
                        <p>Yes, you may have the option to renew your payday loan once you have paid off your existing
                            loan in full. Your lender will typically carry out a series of checks to determine how much
                            you can borrow and if a payday loan is still right for you. This may involve being declined,
                            receiving a lower or similar amount, or even a much higher amount if you have built up trust
                            with the lender.</p>
                        <p><b>What if I am Unable To Repay My Payday Loan on My Due Date?</b></p>
                        <p>If you are struggling to make repayment, you must alert your lender as soon as possible.
                            Typically, late repayment will incur late fees, additional interest and it will negatively
                            impact your credit score. However, you can limit this by speaking to your lender and
                            explaining your situation. The lender may be able to extend or delay repayment and remove
                            any added fees – so the most honest and open you are with them, the better.</p>
