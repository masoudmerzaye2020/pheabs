            <p>A payday advance refers to an advance on your monthly income and rather than waiting until your next
              payday from work, you can receive the money upfront. Also known as a cash advance, this type of loan is
              designed to help you pay for any pressing or immediate expenses, so you can receive the money in one lump
              sum upfront to pay off your expense and then repay the loan in full on your next payday from work. Some
              advances last just a few weeks, but some can last a few months, giving you the option to repay over
              monthly installments. </p>

            <h1 class="title orange ">What Are Loan Advances Used For?</h1>
            <p>Payday advances are often used for immediate or emergency expenses, when you do not have quite enough
              money to tide you over this month. Whether it is to pay any household bills, car repairs, plumbing
              problems, home repairs or maybe you need to borrow money to pay for something for your children.</p>
            <p>We can always try to save money but we can never be sure when life’s little problems are going to crop
              up. From a funeral expense, medical bill or literally a hole in the floor, there are lots of reasons why
              we may need an extra $300, $500 or $1,000 and a payday advance can help you stay on top of your finances.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title orange">Does Pheabs Offer Payday Advances for Bad Credit?</h1>
            <p>Yes, if you are looking for payday advances for bad credit histories, this is something that we can help
              with. We work with a number of US lenders and many of them are willing to take a view on poor credit
              histories. </p>
            <p>We appreciate that not everyone can have a perfect credit score and there are options available if you
              have fair or bad credit. Perhaps we can slightly adjust the amount you have requested to borrow or the
              rate charged will be a little higher. </p>
            <p>If you have a regular income and stable employment, you can certainly be eligible for the loan you need.
              In some cases, we may just require proof of income, just to ensure that you can repay your loan without
              falling into financial difficulty.</p>
            <h1 class="title orange">Can Pheabs Offer Payday Advances Near Me?</h1>
            <p>Yes, we are connected to hundreds of local payday stores, but primarily we work with online payday
              advance lenders, so that you can be matched with the right lender for you, wherever you are in the
              country. </p>
            <p>This type of product is closely tied with payday loans, which are offered in 37 US states and we are
              pleased to offer you an affordable option in areas including Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa,
              Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio Texas, Tennessee and more.</p>
            <h1 class="title orange">Do You Offer Payday Advance Apps?</h1>
            <p>Yes, our panel of lenders includes payday advance apps, which allow you to borrow money on demand and
              keep track of your payments in real-time. Some borrowers prefer to use apps because it gives you access to
              everything you need directly from your cell phone, including the loan terms, repayment dates and the
              outstanding balance. Some apps have extra features including advice on saving money, budgeting and topping
              up your loan if you need to.</p>

        <h1 class="title orange">How Can I Get a Fast Payday Advance Loan?</h1>
        <p>Some payday advances are available on the same day, especially if you are looking to borrow small amounts of
          $100 or $200. If you pass the criteria and have applied during working hours of 9AM to 5PM, this should help
          you receive your loan within a few hours or immediately. </p>
        <p>For larger loans of $1,000 or $2,000, this may require some extra checks to confirm your income and
          employment and may just take a little longer – but it is still common to get your loan on the same day or next
          business day.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a quick loan, you should always give your real information in terms of your name,
          contact details and income – so this will avoid the lender having to ask more questions and potentially
          slowing down your application.</p>
        <p>In addition, once you have applied, try to stay near to your cell phone and email and be ready to respond to
          the lender if they have any queries. Being available, especially during regular trading hours can help get
          your loan funded as soon as possible.</p>

        <h1 class="title orange">Can I Pay Back My Payday Advance in Installments?</h1>
        <p>Yes, whilst most payday advances are paid in full on your next pay date, there is the option to borrow for as
          long as 60 months if you would like to. This gives you the flexibility to spread repayment over time, which
          can be better for borrowing larger amounts of $5,000, $10,000 or more. In this case, you would repay your loan
          in equal monthly installments, so it would be the same amount being collected from your bank account each
          month and you will always have the option to repay early if you would like to.</p>

        <h1 class="title orange">Can You Offer a Payday Advance with No Credit Checks?</h1>
        <p>Yes, it is possible to get a payday advance without credit checks – but most US lenders will carry out a
          credit check to confirm your eligibility. </p>
        <p>It is possible to get loans with no credit checks, such as applying with a credit union or borrowing from
          family and friends. Or you can consider using secured loans or title loans that use your car as collateral –
          where your eligibility is based on the value of your collateral, rather than your credit score.</p>
        <p>But even if you are trying to avoid credit checks for the fear of being declined – do not worry. The lenders
          that work with Pheabs are able to take a view on different credit histories, with a number of them
          specialising in bad credit. Provided that you have a stable employment, regular income and can afford monthly
          repayments, you can certainly get the loan you need.</p>

              <p> Pheabs offers loans of $100 to $35,000 based on factors such as your income, residential status,
                credit score and the amount of debts you have outstanding. We may require proof of income and employment
                for those looking to borrow larger amounts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="second">

              <p>For borrowing small amounts, it is possible to be approved and funded in less than 1 hour. For larger
                loans or those that require proof of income and other details, it is typical to receive funds within 24
                hours or the next business day. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="third">

              <p>The average payday advance lasts around 21 to 28 days and is borrowed upfront and repaid in full on
                your next pay date. However, we are pleased to offer loans over 3,6,12 months or even as long as 60
                months if you want to spread repayment over time. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fourth">

              <p>Depending on the length of your loan and other factors such as your credit score, the cost of your
                payday advance can range from 36% to 500% APR. If your loan lasts just a few weeks, this is likely to be
                presented as a high APR, since the loan is compounded as though it lasts for one year – even though this
                is not the case.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fifth">

              <p> No, Pheabs is not a direct lender, we act as a broker or middleman for those looking for affordable
                short-term loans. However, you can have peace of mind that we can match your loan application with a
                number of responsible US lenders. With no fees for applying, Pheabs can maximise your chances of getting
                you a loan and once confirmed, you can work directly with your chosen lender every step of the way. </p>

                Yes, you can apply if you are self-employed. Whilst you may need to show proof of a regular income,
                being self-employed will not impact your chances of being approved and you will be treated like any
                other customer who is regularly employed.

              <p>If you cannot pay back your loan, you may be charged added interest, late fees and it could negatively
                impact your credit score. If you feel that you are struggling to repay your loan, you should contact
                your lender as early as possible who may be able to help. By notifying your lender, they could lower
                your interest or give you extra time to repay. By avoiding the lender and not responding, this will
                trigger late fees and any other penalties.
