          <h1 class="title green center">How Can I Get Fast Cash with Pheabs?</h1>
          <p class="center">When looking for fast cash online, Pheabs is a legit, trusted and regulated broker who can
            connect you to the lender who is most likely to accept your requirements, even if you have bad credit. We
            offer a number of fast options including payday loans, emergency loans and title car loans – helping you get
            the quick funds that you need. </p>
          <p class="center">To help move your application along as fast as possible, you should try to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="center"><b>Give fully accurate information,</b> including your address, income and bank details.
              Anything that is slightly off, could be questioned by the team and require you to provide proof or
              documentation</li>
            <li class="center"><b>Make sure the application is for yourself</b>, not for someone else. The team may pick
              this up and therefore ask to speak to the original borrower</li>
            <li class="center"><b>Apply during work hours of Monday to Friday 9AM to 5PM</b> – whilst we fund on
              weekends, any manual checks will happen during the work day and this will speed up the process for you
            </li>
            <li class="center"><b>Borrow a realistic amount</b> – just because you want to borrow $1,000 or $5,000, this
              may need to be adjusted with your income and ability to make repayments. Always consider how much you
              realistically need and can afford.</li>
            <li class="center"><b>Be available</b> – be sure to stay by the phone or your email address for any follow
              up calls or responses from the lender and this will help move things along quicker.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="center">Other than getting a fast cash loan, there are some other excellent options which include
            speaking to family and friends or selling old items that you no longer need. This may be better if you have
            bad credit and plus, this will often be interest-free and a simple way to get money if you need it. But if
            you are looking for something online and are in a hurry, Pheabs is happy to be your lending partner when you
            need us.</p>

            <p>Credit checking is always a key part of processing a loan enquiry, but our partners are happy to take a
              view and they can still give you a loan decision if you meet other criteria such as being employed and
              having a stable income. Our technology is automated and will carry out a number of income and
              affordability checks to ensure that you borrow the right amount, without falling into financial trouble.

              loan which is interest free and with no repayment terms, to help you get back on your feet. You can also
              speak to a credit union or debt professional, so that you can build up your credit score and improve your
              financial position. However, if you would like a fast loan which is effective and you are certain that you
              can pay it back in a few week’s time, Pheabs is delighted to be here to help you right away.</p>

          <h1 class="center orange title">Can I Get Fast Cash with Bad Credit and No Credit Checks?</h1>
          <p class="center">Yes, there are opportunities to get fast cash with bad credit scores, but the amount you can
            borrow and the rate charged may be slightly adjusted. There is a myth that you cannot get a loan with a very
            bad or poor credit score, however, assuming that you have stable income and employment and are committed to
            repaying your loan on time at the end of the week or the month, there are a number of lenders who are happy
            to work with you.</p>
          <p>Plus, by working with Pheabs, we have a number of bad credit lenders on our panel, so they are prepared to
            see credit scores of 500, 550 and 600 and will be able to present a number of competitive options.</p>
          <p>For this reason, you may be searching for fast cash with no credit checks. Whilst credit checks are a key
            part of any loan application, we may be able to offer alternatives such as cash advances, credit union
            products, title loans or secured loans to help you get the funds you need.</p>

              How Do Repayments Work?</h1>
            <p>Your repayments will be collected from your bank account on a scheduled pay date that you select – with
              most customers choosing a date at the end of each month.</p>
            <p>If your loan only lasts for one month (see payday loans online), then you will likely pay the entire loan
              and interest in full on your next payday from work.</p>
            <p>If your loan lasts for 3,6,12 months or longer, you will typically pay back in equal monthly instalments
              (see installment loans).</p>
            <p>The lender will automatically collect repayments from your account and send you a reminder by email and
              SMS on the days leading up to collection, so you are fully aware and there are no surprises.</p>
            <h1 class="title orange">Why Would I Need Fast Cash?</h1>
            <p>People often need fast cash when there is a household emergency or they need a little extra money to see
              them through the month. </p>
            <p>Common household problems include money for car repairs, broken broilers, plumbing disasters and maybe
              just to clear the bills piling up on the kitchen table.</p>
