                    <div class="underline mx-auto my-lg"></div>
                    <p>A short term loan allows you to borrow between $100 to $35,000 but for a short-term period of
                        just a few months. At Pheabs, we offer loans that are repaid over 1 to 60 months in equal
                        installments and they are designed to tide you over until you get into a better financial
                        position, or perhaps if you have a particular purchase or expense, such as a new car, starting a
                        business, debt consolidation or even a wedding.</p>
                    <p>You can receive money upfront and use this for your purchase and then you simply repay the loan
                        each month and this is collected on a date that you agree with the lender, usually the last
                        working day of the month when you receive your salary from work.</p>
                    <p>Examples of short term loans include unsecured, payday and installment loans, since these are
                        usually for a short-term purposes and are not for the long-term, such as a mortgage.</p>
                    <p>At Pheabs, we work with a number of short term lenders in the USA, including stores and apps, so
                        that you have a wide choice and can be connected to the right lender for you.</p>

                    <h1 class="title orange">Does Pheabs offer Short Term Loans for Bad Credit?</h1>
                    <p>Yes, we can facilitate short term loans for poor credit histories. You just need to make sure
                        that you meet the eligibility criteria which includes being over 18 and having a stable
                        employment and income so that you can afford to repay your loan on time.</p>
                    <p>At Pheabs, we understand that keeping a perfect track record when it comes to your credit history
                        is not always possible and there are emergencies that can happen. But if you are committed to
                        repaying your loan on time each month, we are delighted to offer a a number of short term
                        lenders that can assist you today.</p>
                    <p>Not every lender specialises in good credit loans, some of our partners offer products for people
                        with bad credit. To facilitate this, they may offer slightly higher rates, or longer term loans
                        which give you more breathing space to pay back. Our partners may also suggest products such as
                        secured loans or title collateral loans against your car, which means that you do not need a
                        good credit score to be eligible.</p>

                        <p>The criteria for a short term loan is that you are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Living in the US full-time</li>
                            <li>Over the age of 18</li>
                            <li>Stable employment</li>
                            <li>Earning a minimum of $800 per month (either part-time or full-time)</li>
                            <li>Have a live checking account for your loan to be deposited into</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our partners will always carry out a series of checks to ensure that you can repay your loan
                            on time and without falling into financial difficulty. Most of our lenders will carry out a
                            credit check, but our partners will always happily consider different credit scores and
                            backgrounds.</p>

                        <p>No, Pheabs is not a direct lender since we match your loan enquiry with the best lender in
                            the US who can approve it and offer you the best rates. We are a technology-driven platform
                            which processes thousands of data points when you apply for a loan – and this allows us to
                            find the best lender for you.</p>
                        <p>There are certainly benefits of working with a direct lender, since it means that your
                            details are not being passed around and you know exactly who you are working with.</p>
                        <p>But do not fear, Pheabs is passionate about offering a secure platform and once you have been
                            given a loan decision, you can work with your chosen lender every step of the way. You can
                            have peace of mind that your details are safe, they will not be shared with third parties
                            and that there are no other middlemen involved.</p>
                        <h1 class="title orange">How Do My Loan Repayments Work?</h1>
                        <p>Your short term loan repayments are collected in equal monthly installments, depending on the
                            duration of your loan which ranges from 1 to 60 months.</p>
                        <p>Our repayments are collected automatically using a system known as ACH which means that
                            collections are taken automatically from your account on the due date, which is usually the
                            last working day of the month.</p>
                        <p>This means that payments are taken automatically and therefore you do not need to call up,
                            make a manual payment or go to the bank, since this is all straightforward.</p>
                        <p>You will always have the option to repay your loan early by contacting the lender directly.
                            In fact, clearing your account could save you a lot of money since less interest is adding
                            up. So the longer you keep your loan open, the more it will cost.</p>

                            your monthly income, expenses, how much you wish to borrow and how long for. Simply click
                            proceed and we will run a number of checks to partner you with the best lender on our
                            network.</p>

                        <p>You will receive an immediate decision on the screen with a provisional loan offer and you
                            can choose to proceed right away! You will need to electronically sign the loan agreement
                            using a PIN code sent to your cell phone and a unique email link sent to your email address
                            – and this takes just a few moments. Your chosen lender will then undergo some further
                            checks and get your loan application ready for funding.</p>

                            can be sent to you in one lump sum upfront to your bank account. Funds can be available in
                            just 15 minutes or 1 hour, with larger loans taking just a little longer – although this is
                            often the same day or next working day. Success!</p>

                <h1 class="title orange">Why Should I Use Pheabs As My Short Term Lender?</h1>
                <p>When looking for short term loan companies, Pheabs is delighted to be here when you need us. With a
                    fully online process and no upfront fees, we aim to get you a loan decision and funds into your bank
                    account as fast as we can.</p>
                <p>Acting as a loans connection service, we can significantly maximise your chances of being approved
                    and funded today. Rather than going to each lender one-by-one or queuing up at the bank – we can
                    connect you to over 50 competitive lenders immediately and you will be presented with the most
                    affordable loan offer, personalised just for you.</p>
                <p>With options available for bad credit scores and no credit checks, we have successfully helped
                    thousands of customers to date and are pleased to be your short term loans partner. Plus, we take
                    extra precaution to keep your details safe and we will not pass these on to any other companies
                    without your permission.</p>
                <h1 class="title orange">Can I Get A Short Term Loan With No Credit Checks?</h1>
                <p>If you are looking for short term loans without credit checks, this might be tricky since most of our
                    lenders will run a credit check to confirm your eligibility. After all, being able to see your
                    previous credit history and how well you have paid other types of loans or credit cards is a good
                    indication of your future behaviour.</p>
                <p>But if you want no credit check loans, we have a number of lenders on our panel who can accommodate
                    different requirements and circumstances – so do not worry!</p>
                <p>For example, you may be presented with an option from a credit union, an app or even a secured
                    product such as a title loan or home loan, where you require collateral and your credit score is not
                    required.</p>
                <h1 class="title orange">What Information Do I Need to Apply For a Short Term Loan?</h1>
                <p>You will just need to enter some basic details about yourself, including your name, age, address,
                    income, employment, expenses, driver’s license number or state ID, valid checking account, phone
                    number, email address and the loan amount and how long for.</p>
                <p>With Pheabs, you will be matched with a partner lender automatically and if you wish to go ahead,
                    they will undergo some additional checks and if successfully approved, your loan can be funded in 24
                    hours or the next business day.</p>

                            <p> We offer loans between $100 to $35,000 and the amount you can borrow will depend on how
                                much you earn per month, your employment, residential status, credit score and
                                affordability. For longer term loans, these are likely to be spread over longer periods

                            <p> Pheabs offers loans over 1 to 60 months, repaid in installments, so you have the option
                                for a quick loan or one that is much longer term. You always have the option to repay
                                your loan early if you would like to and you can usually save money by doing so.</p>

                                $1,000. For larger loans, this can still be made available on the same day (24 hour),
                                next day or within a few days of applying. </p>

                            <p>A short term loan costs from 36% to 600% APR depending on how good your credit score is
                                and other factors such as your income and residential status. Payday products are
                                usually around the 300% to 600% APR mark because they are usually for short term
                                purposes, but multiplied again and again as though they last an entire year. More
                                personal or unsecured loans for good credit are around the 36% APR mark – and other
                                factors such as the state you live in can also determine how high or low the rate is.

                            <p>If you are struggling to repay, your lender will be in touch to discuss a more affordable
                                arrangement. This may involve spreading repayment over several months or years to help
                                you pay back your balance in a more affordable way. Defaulting on payments may incur
                                late fees and also negatively impact your credit score. Always speak to your lender as
                                early as possible to avoid any negative implications.
