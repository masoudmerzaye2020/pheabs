                                should not define your future. If your financial position is improving and you are

                        <p>Well, there are a number of US lenders who are willing to offer loans for people with bad
                            credit – and this is the foundation of their business. These lenders understand that keeping
                            a perfect credit score is very difficult, especially with rising living costs and emergency
                            situations which can require money fast and can easily make you fall behind on payments.
                        </p>
                        <p>So if it is guaranteed approval loans that you are looking for, there are a number of bad
                            credit loan companies out there and their loan products are adjusted to suit people with
                            poor credit histories. Perhaps the loan terms are a little longer and you can pay back in
                            multiple installments, or maybe there is just a limit to the amount you can borrow. In some
                            cases, the rates charged might be a little higher to reflect the potential risk of default.
                        </p>
                        <p>But just because you have a bad credit score does not mean that you are not trying to improve
                            or could be a good person to lend to. In fact, you may have overcome a tough situation and
                            are now on the road to improving your credit score.</p>
                        <p>If you have a very poor credit rating, Pheabs have a number of lenders who are willing to
                            consider your application. You just need to have a stable income and can commit to making
                            your repayments on time each month.</p>
                        <h1 class="title orange">Do You Offer Emergency Loans for Bad Credit?</h1>
                        <p>Yes, you can get approved for bad credit loans for emergencies, whether you have a broken
                            down car, medical bill or plumbing problem at home, you can borrow $1,000, $2,000 or more to
                            fix everything and get back on your feet. </p>
                        <p>Although we always try hard to have money saved for a rainy day, you can never be sure when
                            an emergency will arise. Whilst emergencies are always difficult and tricky to pay for, the
                            last thing you want is to be declined because of bad credit – but fear not, there are a
                            number of lenders who will gladly consider your application.</p>
                        <p>When it is an emergency loan, we appreciate that you will need cash quickly, so with an
                            instant decision and fully online process, Pheabs can approve your loan on the same day and
                            sometimes, you can receive money to your bank account in just a few hours.

                        <p>No, we cannot offer guaranteed bad credit loans, but we can help to match your personal
                            details and loan requirements with the lender, app or credit union who is most likely to
                            approve you and offer you the most affordable rates. We understand how difficult it can be
                            if you need a loan and are finding yourself getting turned down at every place.</p>
                        <p>At Pheabs, we are delighted to offer a free solution where you can apply with multiple
                            lenders at once, with no fees for using our service and no impact to your credit score
                            either. A loan can never be guaranteed and an individual will always need to be approved and
                            show that they can afford to make their repayment on time and without falling into financial
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <h1 class="title orange">How Fast Can You Do Quick Loans for Bad Credit?</h1>
                        <p>Pheabs can offer quick loans for people with bad credit on the same day, next business day or
                            sometimes within just a few hours. We have already successfully completed some loans within
                            1 hour of approval. </p>
                        <p>When applying for small loans for bad credit or unsecured products, these are usually
                            processed automatically through income, credit scoring and affordability – so the process
                            can be much faster and you can receive funds on the same day.</p>
                        <p>If you are looking to borrow a large loan or you may need to use collateral such as a car or
                            property, this requires more checks and validation and therefore it can take a few days to
                            process.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>Yes, you can choose to repay over 1 or 2 months, or use an installment loan to repay over 3,6 or
                        12 months, usually in equal monthly installments.</p>
                    <p>This can certainly help people with bad credit to spread the cost of repayment into smaller
                        amounts, making it more flexible and manageable to pay off. Plus, you always have the option to
                        pay back early if you need to. So if the loan lasts for 24 or 36 months, you could pay back in
                        half that time if you prefer to and you will often save money since less interest is accrued.

                    <p>If you are looking for a bad credit loan with no credit checks, you will probably need to
                        consider using some form of collateral, such as a property, car, bike, van or anything else with
                        value. This is where you are able to borrow against something valuable, so credit scores are
                        less important here, but ultimately you could risk losing your collateral if you do not keep up
                        with repayments.</p>

                            <p>Yes, the rates charges tend to be higher for people with bad credit histories to reflect
                                the potential risk of default. This is across all financial products including car
                                loans, credit cards and personal loans.</p>

                            <p>We can never offer guaranteed loans for bad credit since every application will be
                                subject to an income and credit check – and we cannot guarantee a loan since you will
                                need to proof that you can afford to repay on time and not fall into financial
                                difficulty.</p>

                            <p>If you cannot pay back your loan, you will be charged late fees and this will have a
                                negative impact on your credit score, making it harder to access finance in the future.
                                If you are having trouble repaying, make sure you speak to your lender as soon as
                                possible and they may be able to freeze repayments and remove late charges.</p>

                            <p>This will depend on your credit score and also the amount you are looking to borrow. If
                                you are looking to borrow a very large amount, you may need to use some kind of security
                                e.g a car or valuable item as collateral. If you have a very bad credit score, you may
                                need collateral to be approved, but Pheabs is pleased to offer both secured and
                                unsecured loan options for its customers.</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can still get a loan if you have been declined elsewhere. US lenders are always
                                changing their criteria based on their risk appetites and funding levels – so even if
                                you have been declined before, this can certainly change. At Pheabs, we work with a huge
                                market of loan providers who can help, taking all credit histories into consideration.

                                In addition to bad credit loans, you can always consider borrowing money from family and
                                friends since this will usually be interest-free and not subject to any credit checks.
                                You can also consider your local bank or credit union, who may take a different view if
                                you are a member. Plus, there is always the option to sell old things online or at a
                                garage sale and you could bring in a few hundred dollars if you need to!
