          <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
            <p>An installment loan allows you to spread repayments over several months, or installments. Whether you are
              applying for $300, $500 or $1,000, this gives the customer the flexibility to repay over a longer period
              of time, so they can get their finances in order and not feel the pressure to pay the entire loan back
              immediately, like with a payday loan.</p>
            <p>This type of product can be unsecured or secured (with collateral), depending on the loan amount, the
              duration and the customer’s credit rating.</p>
            <p>Loans with installments can be just a few weeks, or several months – and Pheabs gives you the option to
              choose how long you would like to borrow money for, whether it is 9 months, 18 months, 36 months or the
              maximum of 60 months (5 years).</p>
            <p>You always have the option to repay early if you would like, so if you find that after a couple of months
              or half way through the loan term that you would like to clear your account, you can certainly do so – and
              you will save money overall since less interest has accrued. </p>

          <h1 class="title orange">Can I Get an Installment Loan with Bad Credit?</h1>
          <p>Yes, Pheabs can offer installment loans for people with bad credit histories – and we work with a number of
            lenders who only serve customers with poor credit or no credit at all. </p>
          <p>Installment loans work perfectly for people with bad credit who may be trying to get their finances in
            order, since they can spread repayment over several months to maybe help pay off other debts and get back on
            their feet.</p>
          <p>Whilst Pheabs offers unsecured options, you may find that you have to use collateral or security in order
            to borrow larger amounts if you have adverse credit – since this allows you to leverage the value of your
            item to borrow money, although you may risk losing this if you cannot keep up with repayments.</p>
          <p>You may find that the interest rates charged for people with poor credit could be a little higher to
            reflect the risk of default. Plus, you may find that the amount you can borrow may be a little less and the
            duration a little longer to give you more breathing space. See also loans for bad credit.</p>
          <h1 class="title orange">Do You Offer Installment Loans with No Credit Checks?</h1>
          <p>If you are looking for installment loans without credit checks, it is possible if you apply for a secured
            loan or auto loan, since you will be leveraging the value of your property or vehicle to get access to
            funds. In this case, the value of your item is more important, since the lender uses this as security, and
            your credit score may be less important and there may not be credit checks involved. </p>
          <p>However, it is noted that most USA lenders will carry out credit checks before approving your loan. An
            installment lender will need to confirm that you can afford to repay your loan and taking out additional
            funds will not put you into greater financial difficulty. A quick credit check can see if you have lots of
            other outstanding loans or bad debts – and a lender may make a decision based on this.</p>

            <p>The eligibility criteria for an installment loan will depend on various factors including your credit
              score and affordability, however, the basic criteria to apply is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be a US citizen.</li>
              <li>Over 18 years of age</li>

              <li>A steady income of at least $800 per month</li>
              <li>Able to afford monthly repayments</li>
              <li>No recent bankruptcy</li>
              <li>Valid cell phone and email address to verify your loan</li>

          <h1 class="title orange">What Are The Types of Installment Loans?
          </h1>
          <p><b>Short term and long term installment loans</b> – When you apply, you can choose to borrow over a short
            term such as 1,3 or 6 months or you may prefer to borrow for long-term over 1,3 or 5 years. This may depend
            on your loan requirements and what you are using the finance for.</p>
          <p>For an emergency purpose such as a medical bill, household repair or for paying rent, you find that just a
            few months will suffice. Otherwise, for something like debt consolidation, starting a business or paying
            college tuition, a long term option may be better suited. Either way, you always have the option to repay
            the loan early if you wish and you will often save money on the overall interest.</p>
          <p><b>Unsecured</b> – This is where your loan is not secured against physical or valuable such as a house or
            car. Instead, your eligibility is based on your income, credit score and affordability for a loan. If you
            cannot repay, you will be charged late fees and your credit score will be negatively affected, but your home
            or any other items will not be repossessed.</p>
          <p><b>Secured</b> – This is a loan which is connected to a valuable item such as your home, apartment, car,
            van or bike – and the amount you can borrow will depend on the value of your collateral or asset. The rates
            for this can be very low, since you are bartering with something valuable, however, if you cannot meet the
            repayments, your item or collateral may be repossessed or sold off in order to cover your debts.</p>
          <h1 class="title orange">How Do Repayments Work?</h1>
          <p>Your repayments are typically made in equal monthly installments, so you know exactly how much you will be
            repaying each month and that amount will not change. So if you are paying back $300 each month for a loan of
            12 months, then it is a pretty straightforward process.</p>
          <p>You will always have the option to repay early if you want to, whether it is to clear your account in part
            or in-full and this can be a useful way if you are looking to save money on interest, since less interest
            will therefore be accruing overall. To repay early, simply call up or email your lender and or log into
            their online portal to make full payment.</p>
          <p>If you miss any payments, you will be able to speak to the lender and maybe ask for an extension, however,
            late fees will usually apply and falling behind on repayments could negatively impact your credit score.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="third">

              <p> You can borrow for 1 to 60 months and you can choose how long you would like to borrow for. Usually if
                you want to borrow larger amounts, this could be better to repay over 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 months – to
                help you spread the repayment effectively. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fourth">

              <p>Yes, technically the longer you borrow for, the more interest you will be paying each day, week and
                month. So ideally, you should only borrow as much as you need to avoid overpaying for your loan. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fifth">

              <p> If your loan has been accepted and you have passed all further checks, you can receive funds in just a
                few hours or certainly by the next business day. If you are using a secured loan, this may require some
                further checks – so you could expect completion and funding to take up to 4 weeks. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="sixth">

              <p>Yes, you repayments will typically be made in the equal amounts on the same day each month, on a date
                that you confirm with the lender. Most lenders will charge you the same amount each month, making it
                easy to budget, plan and remember how much you owe. There are some lenders who start the loan by
                repaying small amounts and then the repayments get larger, and visa versa, so always be sure to read the
                terms of your agreement before you proceed.


              </p>

              <p>
                Yes, you will always have the option to repay early and there are usually no added fees for doing so. So
                if you find that your financial position has improved and you want to clear the account after just a few
                months, you can certainly do so and you may save money too, since less interest is adding up overall.
